    "Automation of pipette training.  The input to your process is a flatfile with a list of student names. The output is a file with an evaluation of pipetting competence.ï‚§It should include students delivering 0.5 uL of viscous liquid, 25 uL of watery liquid, and 1000 uL of watery liquid.  Minimally.  That is my standard in-person quiz. It may involve additional containers and the preparation of dilutions.  Steps that require mixing of liquids would be good to include. ï‚§Beyond that the project is pretty open-ended, and the rest of this is suggestions which you can ignore if you think of something better.ï‚§The code will presumably ask students to do pipetting involving transfer of fluorescent liquids into positions of 96-well plates.  The plate is then read for fluorescence and students are scored automatically from the data.ï‚§You may ask an experimentalist to perform any actions required that can be completed in <<1 hr and return you data.  It would be wise for you two to do it too so that you know exactly what youâ€™re dealing with.ï‚§It would be nice if the liquid handling operations were expressed as a Semiprotocol file, which would then be compatible with the PipetteAid being built.ï‚§20 pipetting operations is a ballpark limit to avoid being excessively time-consumingï‚§You can work together or separately on different approaches"
